# Noridoc: slashcommands

Path: @/plugin/src/installer/features/slashcommands

### Overview

Feature loader that installs profile-specific slash commands into Claude Code. Slash commands are user-invocable workflows defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter, registered to ~/.claude/commands/ and accessible as /command-name in Claude Code conversations.

### How it fits into the larger codebase

This feature loader (loader.ts) is registered with @/plugin/src/installer/features/loaderRegistry.ts and executed during installation. It reads slash command definitions from profile directories at ~/.claude/profiles/{profileName}/slashcommands/ (populated by @/plugin/src/installer/features/profiles) and copies them to ~/.claude/commands/ (CLAUDE_COMMANDS_DIR from @/plugin/src/installer/env.ts). The loader determines which profile to use from Config.profile.baseProfile (defaults to 'senior-swe'), enabling profile-specific command sets. Each profile can define different slash commands tailored to its use case.

### Core Implementation

The registerSlashCommands() function (loader.ts:47-101) reads the profile name from config.profile.baseProfile, constructs the source path via getConfigDir() to ~/.claude/profiles/{profileName}/slashcommands/, creates ~/.claude/commands/ if needed, and copies all .md files (excluding docs.md) to the commands directory. Each slash command is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing 'description' (command summary) and optionally 'allowed-tools' (restricts which tools Claude can use). The unregisterSlashCommands() function (loader.ts:108-154) removes only the .md files that exist in the profile's slashcommands directory, leaving other user-created commands intact. The validate() function (loader.ts:163-233) verifies ~/.claude/commands/ exists and checks that all expected slash commands from the profile are present. Built-in commands include /initialize-noridocs (uses nori-initial-documenter subagent), /nori-info (displays feature documentation), /nori-debug (runs npx nori-ai check), /switch-nori-profile (switches active profile via npx nori-ai switch-profile), /nori-create-profile (guides users through creating custom profiles by cloning and customizing existing profiles), and /sync-noridocs (paid feature that bulk syncs all local docs.md files to server-side noridocs via the sync-noridocs skill).

### Things to Know

Slash commands are profile-specific, meaning different profiles can provide different command sets. Commands can also be tier-specific - the \_paid mixin at @/plugin/src/installer/features/profiles/config/\_mixins/\_paid/slashcommands/ contains slash commands only available to paid users (currently /sync-noridocs and /nori-toggle-session-transcripts). The \_base mixin provides core commands available to all users (initialize-noridocs, nori-info, nori-debug, switch-nori-profile, nori-create-profile). The loader follows the profile-based architecture introduced in PR #197 - it reads from ~/.claude/profiles/ rather than from the package's bundled config directory, allowing users to customize slash commands by editing their profile directory. The YAML frontmatter's 'allowed-tools' field can restrict commands to specific tools (e.g., "Task(subagent_type:nori-initial-documenter)" for /initialize-noridocs) or tool patterns (e.g., "Bash(node {{skills_dir}}/sync-noridocs/script.js:\*)" for /sync-noridocs or "Read(~/nori-config.json:\*), Write(~/nori-config.json:\*)" for /nori-toggle-session-transcripts). Changes to slash command files in the profile directory require running 'nori-ai install' to copy updates to ~/.claude/commands/. The loader uses fs.copyFile which overwrites existing files, so reinstalling always updates commands to match the profile definition.

The /nori-toggle-session-transcripts command (paid-tier only) provides user control over session transcript storage. It reads ~/nori-config.json, toggles the sendSessionTranscript field between 'enabled' and 'disabled', saves the updated config, and reports the new state. This works in conjunction with the summarize.ts hook which checks this field before sending transcripts to the backend. The pattern established here (config field → hook conditional → slash command toggle) enables user-controllable feature flags for privacy-sensitive features.

The /nori-create-profile command provides an interactive workflow for creating custom profiles. It displays available profiles from ~/.claude/profiles/, asks the user which profile to clone, validates the new profile name (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only, must not already exist), clones the profile directory structure, creates a profile.json with user-provided description and mixins, and offers to customize CLAUDE.md, skills, subagents, and slash commands. The command includes documentation links to Claude Code docs (https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/) for each customization option. Custom profiles (builtin: false in profile.json) are preserved during Nori upgrades, allowing teams to create and maintain organization-specific profiles. After creation, users can switch to the new profile using /switch-nori-profile.
