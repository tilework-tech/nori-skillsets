# Noridoc: commands

Path: @/src/cli/commands

### Overview

Contains all CLI command implementations for the nori-ai CLI. Each command lives in its own subdirectory with its implementation, tests, and any command-specific utilities co-located together.

### How it fits into the larger codebase

The main CLI entry point (@/src/cli/cli.ts) imports `registerXCommand` functions from each command subdirectory and calls them to register commands with the Commander.js program. Each command module exports a register function that accepts `{ program: Command }` and adds its command definition. Commands access global options (`--install-dir`, `--non-interactive`, `--agent`) via `program.opts()`. Business logic is encapsulated within each command directory - cli.ts only handles routing.

Commands that interact with agent-specific features (install, uninstall, check, switch-profile) use the AgentRegistry (@/src/cli/features/agentRegistry.ts) to look up the agent implementation by name. The agent provides access to its LoaderRegistry, environment paths, and global feature declarations. Commands pass the `--agent` option through their call chain to ensure consistent agent context.

The uninstall command uses two agent methods for global features:
- `agent.getGlobalFeatureNames()`: Human-readable names for displaying in prompts (e.g., "hooks, statusline, and global slash commands")
- `agent.getGlobalLoaderNames()`: Loader names for determining which loaders to skip when preserving global settings (e.g., `["hooks", "statusline", "slashcommands"]`)

Each agent declares its own global features (e.g., claude-code has hooks, statusline, and global slash commands; cursor-agent has hooks and slash commands). If an agent has no global features, the global settings prompt is skipped entirely.

  +-- registerRegistryUploadCommand({ program })--> commands/registry-upload/registryUpload.ts
```

Commands use shared utilities from the parent @/src/cli/ directory:
- `config.ts` - Config type and persistence (with per-agent profile support)
- `logger.ts` - Console output formatting (error, success, info, warn)
- `prompt.ts` - User input prompting
- `version.ts` - Version tracking for upgrades
- `analytics.ts` - GA4 event tracking

Commands obtain feature loaders via the AgentRegistry (@/src/cli/features/agentRegistry.ts). The pattern is:
```typescript
const agentImpl = AgentRegistry.getInstance().get({ name: agentName });
const registry = agentImpl.getLoaderRegistry();
const loaders = registry.getAll();
```

### Core Implementation

**Command Directory Pattern:** Each command directory contains:
- `{command}.ts` - Main implementation with `registerXCommand` export and business logic
- `{command}.test.ts` - Unit/integration tests
- Command-specific utilities (e.g., `install/asciiArt.ts`, `install/installState.ts`)

**Command Registration Pattern:** Each command exports a register function:
```typescript
export const registerXCommand = (args: { program: Command }): void => {
  const { program } = args;
  program
    .command("command-name")
    .description("...")
    .action(async () => {
      const globalOpts = program.opts();
      await main({ installDir: globalOpts.installDir || null });
    });
};
```

**Import Path Pattern:** Commands import from `@/cli/` for shared utilities and `@/cli/features/claude-code/` for loaders. Within the install command, relative imports are used for command-specific utilities (e.g., `./asciiArt.js`, `./installState.js`).

### Things to Know

The `install/` directory contains command-specific utilities:
- `asciiArt.ts` - ASCII banners displayed during installation
- `installState.ts` - Helper to check for existing installations (wraps version.ts)
- `registryAuthPrompt.ts` - Prompts for private registry authentication during interactive install. Collects registry URL, username, and password (hidden input). Supports preserving existing registryAuths from config and adding multiple registries. Uses `RegistryAuth` type from `@/cli/config.js`.

The install command uses `agent.listSourceProfiles()` to get available profiles from the package source directory, combined with `agent.listProfiles({ installDir })` to include any user-installed profiles. This ensures each agent displays its own profiles (claude-code shows amol, senior-swe, etc.; cursor-agent shows its own profiles).

The `install-location/` command was extracted from inline definition in cli.ts to follow the same pattern as other commands.

Tests within each command directory use the same temp directory isolation pattern as other tests in the codebase, passing `installDir` explicitly to functions rather than mocking `process.env.HOME`.
